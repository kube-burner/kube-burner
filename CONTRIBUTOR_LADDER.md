## Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about our project contributor ladder! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows. Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things. "Responsibilities" are things that a contributor is expected to do. "Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role, and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to. Each contributor level includes all the responsibilities, requirements, and privileges of the levels below it.

### Maintainer
Description: Maintainers are established contributors who have responsibility for maintaining the project. They may focus on specific areas (such as code directories, documentation, or test components) or have broader responsibility for the entire project. All maintainers can approve PRs, mentor contributors, and participate in project decision-making.

Maintainers are responsible for a "specific area" or the entire project. A specific area can be a code directory, driver, chapter of the docs, test job, event, or other clearly-defined project component. Senior maintainers have broader knowledge across multiple areas and are responsible for overall project strategy and direction.

* Responsibilities include:
    * Follow the reviewing guide
    * Review Pull Requests, with area maintainers focusing on their specific areas and senior maintainers reviewing across the entire project
    * Review at least 50 PRs per year
    * Help other contributors become maintainers
    * For senior maintainers: 
        * Mentor new maintainers
        * Write refactoring PRs
        * Participate in CNCF maintainer activities  
        * Determine strategy and policy for the project
        * Participate in, and lead, community meetings
* Requirements:
    * Experience as an established Contributor for at least 12 months
    * Has reviewed, or helped review, at least 50 Pull Requests

        * Experience as a Maintainer for at least 12 months
        * Demonstrates broad knowledge of the project across multiple areas
        * Is able to exercise judgment for the good of the project, independent of their employer, friends, or team
        * Mentors other contributors
* Privileges:
    * Has GitHub or CI/CD rights to approve pull requests in specific directories or across the entire project
    * Can recommend and review other contributors to become Maintainers

        * Represent the project in public as a Maintainer
        * Communicate with the CNCF on behalf of the project
        * Have a vote in Maintainer decision-making meetings

Process of becoming a maintainer:
1. The contributor is nominated by opening a PR against the appropriate repository, which adds their GitHub username to the OWNERS file for one or more directories (or the root for senior maintainers).
2. At least two current Maintainers who own that repository or main directory approve the PR.
3. The nominee will add a comment to the PR testifying that they agree to all requirements of becoming a Maintainer.
4. A majority of the current Maintainers must approve the PR.

## Inactivity
It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than *6* months
    * Periods of no communication for longer than *6* months
* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status

## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the current Maintainers.

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process
If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.
