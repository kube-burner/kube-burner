# OpenShift Plugin

While Kube-burner supports operations operations on vanilla k8s, it is also capable of being run against a wide variety of distributions. It is possible to leverage its core functionality to create custom distribution focused plugins that come with canned scenarios tailored to that distribution as well any unique logic or operations. An example of this is the OpenShift Plugin shipped as the [kube-burner-ocp](https://github.com/kube-burner/kube-burner-ocp) binary with OpenShift specific scenarios, templates and objects in a ready to use format. Please refer to the repository for further information on the plugin and how it can be run against OpenShift clusters.
